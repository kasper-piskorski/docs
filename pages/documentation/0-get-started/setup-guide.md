## Download and Install Mindmaps

{% include note.html content="Mindmaps requires Java 8 (Standard Edition) with the `$JAVA_HOME` set accordingly.   
Mindmaps also requires Maven 3." %}

The latest version of mindmaps can be downloaded from the
[downloads page](../resources/downloads.html). Unzip it and run the following in the terminal:

```bash
cd [your Mindmaps install directory]
bin/mindmaps.sh start
```

This will start an instance of Cassandra which serves as the supported backend for Mindmaps.

{% include note.html content="**Useful commands**  <br />
To start Mindmaps graph, run `mindmaps.sh start`.   
To stop Mindmaps graph, run `mindmaps.sh stop`. " %}


## Set up Graql

Graql is our query language, which allows you to interface with a Mindmaps graph. We will use Graql to load an example data set and run some simple queries against it.  
The following will make Graql load an example data set and exit:

```bash
bin/graql.sh -f examples/pokemon.gql
```

This will create and persist an example data set. Now we can run the following query using the Graql shell:

```bash
bin/graql.sh
match $x isa pokemon
$x id "Bulbasaur" isa pokemon;
$x id "Charmander" isa pokemon;
$x id "Pikachu" isa pokemon;
...
```

If you see the above output then congratulations! You have set up Mindmaps.
