**Initialising a Mindmaps Graph in Java**

*(Skip to the following [Introduction](#introduction) section if you will be using Graql exclusively.)*   

Make sure you have Mindmaps Engine running locally by `mindmaps.sh start`. 
Once you have done that a graph can be retrieved by: 

```java
MindmapsGraph mindmapsGraph = MindmapsClient.getGraph();
```

{% include note.html content="Make sure that your project depends on `mindmaps-titan-factory` at a minimum." %}

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.mindmaps</groupId>
    <artifactId>mindmaps-titan-factory</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
 

## Introduction
If you have not yet set up the Mindmaps environment, please see the [Setup guide](../get-started/setup-guide.html).
You can find the example ```philosophers.gql``` in the examples directory included in the Mindmaps download.


We are going model how philosophers are related to each other. If you are using Graql and don't want to type everything below to build up the philosophers ontology, you can load it using:  

```bash
bin/graql.sh -f examples/philosophers.gql
```

By the way, don't worry if you've already loaded some different data into your graph. A Mindmaps Graph can contain as many ontologies as you want.

## Concepts

We'll first add an ontology element - an entity type: `person`...

```bash
bin/graql.sh
>>>insert person isa entity-type;
```
```java
EntityType person = mindmapsGraph.putEntityType("person");
```

...and now some data in the form of concept instances: in our case, a bunch of ancient Greeks...

```sql
>>>insert "Socrates" isa person;
>>>insert "Plato" isa person;
>>>insert "Aristotle" isa person;
>>>insert "Alexander" isa person;
```
```java
Entity socrates = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Socrates", person));
Entity plato = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Plato", person));
Entity aristotle = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Aristotle", person));
Entity alexander = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Alexander", person));
```

So now we've created a super-simple graph, with one concept type and four
concept instances.

{% include note.html content="Every concept needs a type, using `isa`. <br/>   `Plato` `is a` `person`   <br/>  `person` `is a` `entity-type`" %}


{% include tip.html content="Graql shell maintains a history of past commands with the 'up' and 'down' arrows. You can also autocomplete keywords, type and variable names using tab!" %}

We'll quickly check our data has loaded:

```sql
>>>match $p isa person

$p id "Aristotle" isa person;
$p id "Plato" isa person;
$p id "Socrates" isa person;
$p id "Alexander" isa person;
```
```java
System.out.println("Instances of Person:");
 person.instances().forEach(i -> System.out.println(i.getId()));
```

{% include note.html content="Graql variables start with a `$`. They represent wildcards, and are returned as results in `match` queries. A variable name can contain alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores." %}

Next, let's add some `schools` of thought:

```sql
>>>insert school isa entity-type;
>>>insert "Peripateticism" isa school;
>>>insert "Platonism" isa school;
>>>insert "Idealism" isa school;
>>>insert "Cynicism" isa school;
```
```java
EntityType school = mindmapsGraph.putEntityType("school");
Entity peripateticism = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Peripateticism", person));
Entity platonism = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Platonism", person));
Entity idealism = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Idealism", person));
Entity cynicism = mindmapsGraph.putEntity("Cynicism", person));
```

And look up one:

```sql
>>>match $cyn id "Cynicism"

$cyn id "Cynicism" isa school;
```
```java
mindmapsGraph.getEntity("Cynicism").getId();
```

## Relations

How do we define a "philosopher"? Very smart people have argued for a very long time about this, but we're going to put our fingers in our ears and say a philosopher is someone who practices a philosophy.

A relation comprises of pairs of roles and role players. Relations and roles also have types, just like normal concepts.  

First, we define a `relation-type` called `practice` that relates a
`role-type` called `philosopher` to a `role-type` called `philosophy`:

```sql
>>>insert practice isa relation-type;
>>>insert philosopher isa role-type;
>>>insert philosophy isa role-type;
>>>insert practice has-role philosopher, has-role philosophy;
```
```java
RoleType philosopher = mindmapsGraph.putRoleType("philosopher");
RoleType philosophy = mindmapsGraph.putRoleType("philosophy");
RelationType practice = mindmapsGraph.putRelationType("practice").
  hasRole(philosopher).hasRole(philosophy);
```

{% include note.html content="Commas are totally optional in query patterns, so these pairs are equivalent:<br /> ```
>>>insert practice has-role philosopher, has-role philosophy;
>>>insert practice has-role philosopher has-role philosophy;
and  
>>>insert practice, isa relation-type;
>>>insert practice isa relation-type;
```" %}


A `person` can have the role of `philosopher` and a `school` can have the role of `philosophy`:

```sql
>>>insert person plays-role philosopher;
>>>insert school plays-role philosophy;
```
```java
person.playsRole(philosopher);
school.playsRole(philosophy);
```

{% include warning.html content="The changes you've made to the graph haven't been saved yet!  <br /> Type `commit` in the Graql shell to commit any changes." %}

Now let's relate some `philosophers` to their `philosophies`:

```sql
>>>insert (philosopher "Socrates", philosophy "Platonism") isa practice;
>>>insert (philosopher "Plato", philosophy "Idealism") isa practice;
>>>insert (philosopher "Plato", philosophy "Platonism") isa practice;
>>>insert (philosopher "Aristotle", philosophy "Peripateticism") isa practice;
```
```java
mindmapsGraph.putRelation(practice).
  putRolePlayer(philosopher, socrates).
  putRolePlayer(philosophy, platonisim);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(practice).
  putRolePlayer(philosopher, plato).
  putRolePlayer(philosophy, idealism);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(practice).
  putRolePlayer(philosopher, plato).
  putRolePlayer(philosophy, platonisim);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(practice).
  putRolePlayer(philosopher, aristotle).
  putRolePlayer(philosophy, peripateticism);
```

![](/images/practice.png)

Here, `Plato` is playing the role of `philosopher`, and `Idealism` is playing the role of `philosophy`.

Now we can query for all our Platonists:

```sql
>>>match (philosopher $phil, "Platonism") isa practice;

$phil id "Socrates" isa person;
$phil id "Plato" isa person;
```
```java
platonisim.relations(philosophy).forEach(relation -> {
  relation.rolePlayers().values().forEach(rolePlayer -> {
    if (!rolePlayer.equals(platonisim))
      System.out.println("    -> " + rolePlayer.getId());
  });
}); //Pssssstttt Graql is much better at querying relationships!!
```

{% include note.html content="This query can be read as 'Get me philosophers in a practice relationship with Platonism'.  <br/> We didn't specify the role of `Platonism` in this query, or the type of `$phil`, which is totally fine! <br /> Roles and types can be omitted in queries. <br/> For example, the query `match ($x, $y)` is a valid query (that will find *everything* in a relationship with *anything*)." %}

Next let's talk about the relationships between our philosophers. Socrates
taught Plato, Plato taught Aristotle and Aristotle even taught Alexander the
Great!

First, extend our ontology:

```sql
>>>insert education isa relation-type;
>>>insert teacher isa role-type;
>>>insert student isa role-type;
>>>insert education has-role teacher, has-role student;
>>>insert person plays-role teacher, plays-role student;
```
```java
RoleType teacher = mindmapsGraph.putRoleType("teacher");
RoleType student = mindmapsGraph.putRoleType("student");

RelationType education = mindmapsGraph.putRelationType("education").
  hasRole(teacher).hasRole(student);

person.playsRole(teacher).playsRole(student);
```

Second, our data:

```sql
>>>insert (teacher "Socrates", student "Plato") isa education;
>>>insert (teacher "Plato", student "Aristotle") isa education;
>>>insert (teacher "Aristotle", student "Alexander") isa education;
```
```java
mindmapsGraph.putRelation(education).
  putRolePlayer(teacher, socrates).
  putRolePlayer(student, plato);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(education).
  putRolePlayer(teacher, plato).
  putRolePlayer(student, aristotle);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(education).
  putRolePlayer(teacher, aristotle).
  putRolePlayer(student, alexander));
```



{% include tip.html content="**Test Yourself** <br /> Try writing a query to see who taught Aristotle. Include all the roles and types (`teacher`, `student` and `education`), then remove them one by one to see when the results change! The answer is at the bottom of this page." %}

## Resources

Some people have special titles and epithets and we want to talk about that.
So, we'll create some resource types that can be attached to a person:

```sql
>>>insert title isa resource-type, datatype string;
>>>insert epithet isa resource-type, datatype string;
>>>insert person has-resource title, has-resource epithet;
```
```java
ResourceType<String> title = mindmapsGraph.putResourceType("title", Data.STRING);
ResourceType<String> epithet = mindmapsGraph.putResourceType("epithet", Data.STRING);

person.playsRole(hasResourceTarget);
title.playsRole(hasResourceValue);
epithet.playsRole(hasResourceValue);
```

Let's make Alexander "Great"!

```sql
>>>insert "Alexander" has epithet "The Great";
```
```java
Resource<String> theGreat = mindmapsGraph.putResource("The Great", epithet);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, theGreat);
```

This is a quick way to add a relation between `Alexander` and an `epithet` with value `"The Great"`.

![](/images/epithet.png)

Let's add the rest of Alexander's titles while we're at it:

```sql
>>>insert "Alexander" has title "Hegemon";
>>>insert "Alexander" has title "King of Macedon";
>>>insert "Alexander" has title "King of Persia";
>>>insert "Alexander" has title "Pharaoh of Egypt";
>>>insert "Alexander" has title "Lord of Asia";
```
```java
Resource<String> hegemon = mindmapsGraph.putResource("Hegemon", title);
Resource<String> kingOfMacedon = mindmapsGraph.putResource("King of Macedon", title);
Resource<String> shahOfPersia = mindmapsGraph.putResource("Shah of Persia", title);
Resource<String> pharaohOfEgypt = mindmapsGraph.putResource("Pharaoh of Egypt", title);
Resource<String> lordOfAsia = mindmapsGraph.putResource("Lord of Asia", title);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, hegemon);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, kingOfMacedon);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, shahOfPersia);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, pharaohOfEgypt);

mindmapsGraph.putRelation(hasResource).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceTarget, alexander).
  putRolePlayer(hasResourceValue, lordOfAsia);
```

Using Graql, we can query for people, listing their id and titles. 

```sql
>>>match $x isa person select $x(id, has title)

$x id "Socrates";
$x id "Plato";
$x id "Aristotle";
$x id "Alexander" has title "Pharaoh of Egypt" has title "Hegeon" has title "Shah of Persia" has title "King of Macedon" has title "Lord of Asia";
```

Wait, who's the Pharaoh again?

```sql
>>>match $pharaoh has title "Pharaoh of Egypt"

$pharaoh id "Alexander" isa person;
```
```java
pharaohOfEgypt.ownerInstances().forEach(instance -> {
  System.out.println("    ->" + instance.getId());
}); //Pssssstttt Graql is much better at querying relationships!!
```

For the remainder of this tutorial we will exclusively use graql. 
If you would like to learn more about the java api you can do so [here](../core-api/overview.html) or take a look at the [sample projects](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects).

{% include tip.html content="**Test Yourself** <br /> When querying for an id, value or resource you can use predicates as well as direct values. For example, has epithet contains 'Great'. See if you can write a query for everyone with a title containing 'King'. The answer is at the bottom of the page." %}

## Relations as Role Players

Philosophers know lots of things. We should probably include this in our
ontology.

```sql
>>>insert knowledge isa relation-type;
>>>insert thinker isa role-type;
>>>insert thought isa role-type;
>>>insert knowledge has-role thinker, has-role thought;
>>>insert fact isa entity-type, plays-role thought;
>>>insert person plays-role thinker;
```

Aristotle knew some astronomy, Plato knew a lot about caves and Socrates didn't really know anything at all.

```sql
>>>insert "sun-fact" isa fact, value "The Sun is bigger than the Earth";
>>>insert (thinker "Aristotle", thought "sun-fact") isa knowledge;
>>>insert "cave-fact" isa fact, value "Caves are mostly pretty dark";
>>>insert (thinker "Plato", thought "cave-fact") isa knowledge;
>>>insert "nothing" isa fact;
>>>insert (thinker "Socrates", thought "nothing") isa knowledge;
```

A relation is actually just a special kind of instance. Just as
`Socrates` can be a role player, relations themselves can also be role players.

For example, Socrates knew nothing, but he also *knew* that he knew nothing!

First, we have to state that someone can think about their own knowledge:

```sql
>>>insert knowledge plays-role thought;
```

We can now give Socrates one final piece of knowledge:

```sql
>>>match $socratesKnowsNothing ("Socrates", "nothing") insert (thinker "Socrates", thought $socratesKnowsNothing) isa knowledge
```

Here, `socratesKnowsNothing` is the relation between `Socrates` and `nothing`.
We then put `socratesKnowsNothing` in a *new* `knowledge` relation as a role
player.

Finally, we'll check out everything Socrates knows:

```sql
>>>match ("Socrates", $x) isa knowledge

$x id "nothing" isa fact;
$x id "knowledge-e387d27c-4f5e-11e6-beb8-9e71128cae77" isa knowledge;
```

{% include note.html content="If you don't provide an ID for something such as a relation, it will get an automatically generated ID." %}

## Test Yourself: Answers
We asked you to write a query to see who taught Aristotle.   
Graql answers:

```sql
match (teacher $teach, $student Aristotle) isa education
```

We asked you to write a query for everyone with a title containing "King".   
Answer:  

```sql
match $king has title contains "King"
```
