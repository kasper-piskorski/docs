## Strange Exceptions

```bash
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: The vertex or type is not associated with this transaction [v[24584]]
```

This exception occurs when you try to create links between concepts in
different graphs. The following code reproduces this exception:

```java
MindmapsTitanGraphFactory factory = MindmapsTitanGraphFactory.getInstance();
//Configuration pointing to keyspace one
MindmapsGraph mindmapsGraph1 = factory.newGraph("conf1.properties");
//Configuration pointing to keyspace two
MindmapsGraph mindmapsGraph2 = factory.newGraph("conf2.properties");

ConceptType conceptType1 = mindmapsGraph1.putConceptType("1");
ConceptType conceptType2 = mindmapsGraph2.putConceptType("2");

conceptType1.superConcept(conceptType2);
```

## Other Issues

### Ghost Vertices

In a  transaction based environment it is possible to have one transaction
removing a concept while another concurrently modifies the same concept. Both
transactions may successfully commit if the backend is eventually consistent
(e.g. [Titan
Cassandra](http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/1.0.0/common-questions.html)
). The concept is likely to still exist with only the modified properties.
When using the Titan Cassandra backend it is possible to safeguard against
this by setting the `checkInternalVertexExistence` property to true.   
However, this will result in slower transaction as more reads will be necessary.
