## Introduction
This tutorial shows you how to populate Grakn with CSV data. If you have not yet set up the Grakn environment, please see the [setup guide](../get-started/setup-guide.html).

## Migration Shell Script for CSV
The migration shell script can be found in */bin* directory of your Grakn environment. We will illustrate its usage in an example below:

```bash
usage: ./migration.sh csv -template <arg> -input <arg> [-help] [-no] [-separator <arg>] [-batch <arg>] [-uri <arg>] [-keyspace <arg>] [-v]

OPTIONS
 -b,--batch <arg>       number of rows to load at once
 -h,--help              print usage message
 -i,--input <arg>       input csv file
 -k,--keyspace <arg>    keyspace to use
 -n,--no                dry run - write to standard out
 -s,--separator <arg>   separator of columns in input file
 -t,--template <arg>    graql template to apply over data
 -u,--uri <arg>         uri to engine endpoint
 -v,--verbose           print counts of migrated data.
```

## CSV Migration Basics

The steps to migrate the CSV to GRAKN.AI are:

* define an ontology for the data to derive the full benefit of a knowledge graph
* create templated Graql to map the data to the ontology
* invoke the Grakn migrator through the shell script or Java API. The CSV migrator will apply the template to each row of data in the CSV file, replacing the sections indicated in the template with provided data: the column header is the key and the content of each row at that column the value.

{% include note.html content="CSV Migration makes heavy use of the Graql templating language. You will need a foundation in Graql templating before continuing, so please read through our [templating documentation](../graql/graql-templating.html) to find out more." %}


## Example: Cars

Let's take a simple example. First, the CSV file, *cars.csv*:

```csv
Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture",,4900.00
1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL! air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00
```

Here is the ontology for the example:   

```graql
insert

car sub entity
  has-resource name
  has-resource year
  has-resource description
  has-resource price;

name sub resource datatype string;
year sub resource datatype string;
description sub resource datatype string;
price sub resource datatype double;

```

And the Graql template, *car-migrator.gql*:   

```graql-template
insert 

$x isa car 
  has name <Make>-<Model>
  has year <Year>
  has price @double(Price)
  if (ne Description null) do { has description <Description>};
```

The template will create a `car` entity for each row. It will attach `year` and `price` resources to each of these entities. If the `description` resource is present in the data, it will attach the appropriate `description` to the `car`.

The template is applied to each row by calling the migration script:

```bash
./<grakn-install-location>/bin/migration.sh csv -i ./cars.csv -t ./car-migrator.gql
```

The resulting Graql statement, if printed out, looks as follows:

```graql
insert $x0 isa car has name "Ford" has description "ac, abs, moon" has price 3000.0 has year "1997";
insert $x0 isa car has name "Chevy" has price 4900.0 has year "1999";
insert $x0 isa car has description "MUST SELL! air, moon roof, loaded" has price 4799.0 has name "Jeep" has year "1996";
```

You will note that the second Graql insert is missing the `description` resource. This is because that value is not present in the data and the template uses an `if` statement to check if it exists.

### Separator

The `separator` option allows you to specify the column separator. With this we are able to migrate a wider range of formats, including TSV.

```tsv
Year  Make  Model Description Price
1997  Ford  E350  "ac  abs   moon"  3000.00
1999  Chevy "Venture" ""  4900.00
1996  Jeep  Grand Cherokee  "MUST SELL!
air  moon roof   loaded"  4799.00
```

This file would be migrated in the same way as the previous example when you specify the separator using the `-s \t` argument:

```bash
./<grakn-install-location>/bin/migration.sh csv -i ./cars.tsv -t ./car-migrator.gql -s \t
```

## Where Next?
We have an additional, more extensive, example that [migrates genealogy data from CSV](../examples/CSV-migration.html). Our [sample-projects repository on Github](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects) also contains [an example that migrates a simple CSV pets dataset](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-csv-migration-pets), and another [example for video games](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects/tree/master/example-csv-migration-games), was described in a separate [blog post](https://blog.grakn.ai/twenty-years-of-games-in-grakn-14faa974b16e#.do8tq0dm8).

You can find further documentation about migration in our API reference documentation (which is in the */docs* directory of the distribution zip file, and also online [here](https://grakn.ai/javadocs.html).
