## Download Mindmaps

The latest version of mindmaps is v0.1.0.
It can be downloaded from [here](https://mindmaps/io/download/latest).

We currently support Mac OS X and Linux.

### Past Versions
A list of previously released versions of MindmapsDB can be found on [Github](https://mindmaps.io/download).


## Prerequisites

{% include note.html content="Mindmaps requires Java 8 (Standard Edition) with the `$JAVA_HOME` set accordingly.   
Mindmaps also requires Maven 3." %}

## Code
We are an open source project. If you want to look at our code, we are on Github at [https://github.com/mindmapsdb/mindmapsdb](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/mindmapsdb). 

### Building the Code

To build MindmapsDB, you need git and Maven.

Clone the [mindmapsdb repository](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/mindmapsdb) to a local directory.  In that directory:

```bash
mvn package
```

The code should build and the tests will then run (the tests will take approximately 10 minutes to finish). When the build has completed, you will find it in the `mindmaps-dist` directory under `target`. The zip file built into that directory is the same as that distributed as a release on [Github](https://mindmaps.io/download).

### Example Code
You can find an additional repo on Github containing our [example code](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects).


## Mindmaps Java API

Inside the `lib` directory of mindmaps.zip are the jars you will need to
develop with mindmaps.

If you would like to start developing with minimal effort you can integrate the jar file, e.g.
`graql-shell-0.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar` into your project. This however
may be a bit inflexible as all dependencies are compiled in.

If you would like more flexibility, in the `lib` directory all the mindmaps
jars are provided with no dependencies. Using these would require you to use
Maven to acquire the other dependencies.

Here are some links to guides for adding external jars using different IDEs:

- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/configuring-module-dependencies-and-libraries.html)
- [Eclipse](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/eclipse/eclipse_java_build_path.htm)
- [Netbeans](http://oopbook.com/java-classpath-2/classpath-in-netbeans/)

## Troubleshooting
Please see our [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/known-issues.html) page if you encounter any problems when installing and running MindmapsDB. If our guide doesn't cover the issue, please do get in touch on our [discussion forums](http://discuss.mindmaps.io) or on [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).
